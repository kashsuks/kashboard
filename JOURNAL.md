## 10/4/2025 - Followed the guide a teeny tiny tad bit  

I brainstormed for a tad bit. I want this devboard to be about me! I'm gonna follow the guide that's already in place in (/guide). I wanna add a neopixel as well for debug (something that's very helpful for me when I used other devboards or a tiny multicolored LED in order for it to have different colours for when it's on vs when it's in debug).

So far, I've worked up to the USB-C port stuff. Cool thing is that I learn what a bidirectional global tag was! I had no clue those existed.

The USB-C stuff also helped me understand _how_ to use a USB-C receptacle in my schematics (this was something struggled with for a while).
