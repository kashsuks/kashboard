## 10/4/2025 - Followed the guide a teeny tiny tad bit  

I brainstormed for a tad bit. I want this devboard to be about me! I'm gonna follow the guide that's already in place in (/guide). I wanna add a neopixel as well for debug (something that's very helpful for me when I used other devboards or a tiny multicolored LED in order for it to have different colours for when it's on vs when it's in debug).

So far, I've worked up to the USB-C port stuff. Cool thing is that I learn what a bidirectional global tag was! I had no clue those existed.

The USB-C stuff also helped me understand _how_ to use a USB-C receptacle in my schematics (this was something struggled with for a while).

## 10/6/2025 3 PM - Routed the PCB! (and had a lot of issues)  

Ohhhh boy, this was a pain. Time flew by so fast. I spent the first 2 hours routing like normal without following the guide, and it worked well until the very end. The routing was so bad to the point where I couldn't even complete some of the traces.

I removed every single component and went step by step.

I then tried to follow the guide while also having Kai's pcb file open up on split. This allowed me to make sure that I was using the right components and making the right type of wiring and connections. Things such as proper wiring was crucial to my design since it was both aesthetic as well as being efficient.

I wanted to use an autorouter, but resisted it since it wasn't as fun and the autorouter would probably take hours to route this mess. I ended up getting help from Kai and Rudy to make sure that I wasn't fucking up something. Things such as a good amount of vias were something that I overdid since I had like 15 vias in a very small area where there weren't any components. I learned that the vias helped the ground fill properly and spread well across the whole board.

I also spent a good amount of time placing a lot of vias near the LDO and the SoC to make sure there was proper heat dissipation (this was something I learnt from Kai and Valen). I still need to add silkscreen in order to add some art, but I'm basically done with my design.

## 10/6/2025 4 PM - Added silkscreen  

So for the past 30-ish minutes I was thinking what silkscreen I wanted to make my devboard stand out. Initially I thought of adding components makrs so its easier for me to know which parts I'm dealing with, but I thought that was boring and decided to add the board name, the hack club flag, my github username (gotta plug it) and then finally the fact that its a rp2040 board. I also generated the drill and the gerber files to make sure production is smooth.

## 10/8/2025 - Redid the neopixel  

A couple days ago, Kai informed me that my previous design with the APA102 might not work as intended. It requried a Data and Clock pin (**Which is NOT normal**) and so he suggested that I use a sk6182 mini or a normal sk6182. Yes, routing the neopixel part once again is quite tiring (this is like the 4th time I've redone it). It is however very much required. It is definitely possible to use it, however it will be confusing. I did a tad bit of research and looked into Valens old pcb and some other ones and I read the datasheet (ahhhhhhhh) which definitely helped me a lot. I ended up routing it like normal with a +5v, a ground, a gpio pin, and an NC.
